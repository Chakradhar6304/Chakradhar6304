## 🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of

### 🤖 GPT Workflow Assistant
**[📄 Source Code](https://github.com/Chakradhar6304/gpt-workflow-assistant)**
Built a GPT-4 assistant using LangChain + FAISS + Cloud Functions.  
Added prompt tuning + RL to improve contextual accuracy and deploy it as a low-latency microservice.

### 📄 Resume Screening Engine
**[🚀 Live Demo](https://Chakradhar6304.github.io/Resume-Screening-Engine/)** | **[📄 Source Code](https://github.com/Chakradhar6304/Resume-Screening-Engine)**
Used TensorFlow + spaCy to classify resumes and extract structured profiles.  
Fully automated via Python APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized deployment.

### 🔁 CI/CD Data Processing Pipeline
Automated data ingestion and transformation with Docker + CircleCI.  
Used config-driven modules and PowerBI for monitoring.

### 🧾 Real-Time Collaboration App
Django + WebSockets + GCP Cloud Run app with live doc editing and telemetry logging.  
Included accessibility-first UI and GitHub Actions for auto-deployments.
